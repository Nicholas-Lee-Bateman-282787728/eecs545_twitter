abstract = {Twitter provides a new and important tool for politi- cal actors, and is increasingly being used as such. In the 2010 midterm elections, the vast majority of candidates for the U.S. House of Representatives and virtually all can- didates for U.S. Senate and governorships used Twitter to reach out to potential supporters, direct them to particular pieces of information, request campaign contributions, and mobilize their political action. Despite the level of activity, we have little understanding of what the political Twitter- verse looks like in terms of communication and discourse. This project seeks to remedy that lack of understanding by mapping candidates for federal office in 2010 and their followers, according to their use of the 4016 most used hash- tags (keywords). Our data set is uniquely constructed from tweets of most of the candidates running for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2010, all the candidates for the Senate and governorships, and a random sample of their followers. From this we utilize multidimensional scaling to construct a visual map based on hashtag usage. We find that our data have both local and global interpretations that reflect not only political leaning but also strategies of communi- cation. This study provides insight into innovation in new media usage in political behavior, as well as a snapshot of the political twitterverse in 2010.},

@article{Carter2011,
abstract = {The popularity of microblogging platforms, such as Twitter, renders them valuable real-time information resources for tracking various aspects of worldwide events, e.g., earthquakes, political elections, etc. Such events are usually characterized in microblog posts via the use of hashtags (). As microbloggers come from different backgrounds, and express themselves in different languages, we witness different translations of hashtags which, however, are about the same event. Language-dependent variants of hashtags can possibly lead to issues in content-analysis. In this paper, we propose a method for translating hashtags, which builds on methods from information retrieval. The method introduced is source and target language independent. Our method is desirable, either instead of, or complimentary, to the direct translation of the hashtag for three reasons. First we return a list of hashtags on the same topic, which takes into account the plurality and variability of hashtags used by microbloggers for assigning posts to a topic. Second, our framework accounts for the problem that microbloggers in different languages will refer to the same topic using different tokens. Finally, our method does not require special preprocessing of hashtags, reducing barriers to real-world implementation. We present proof-of-concept results for the given Spanish hashtag 33mineros.},

@article{Chen2010,
abstract = {Twitter is one of the fastest growing online social networking services. Tweets can be categorized into trends, and are related with tags and follower/following social relationships. The categorization is neither accurate nor effective due to the short length of tweet messages and noisy data corpus. In this paper, we attempt to overcome these challenges with an extended feature vector along with a semi-supervised clustering technique. In order to achieve this goal, the training set is expanded with Wikipedia topic search result, and the feature set is extended. When building the clustering model and doing the classification, impurity measurement is introduced into our classifier platform. Our experiment results show that the proposed techniques outperform other classifiers with reasonable precision and recall.},

@inproceedings{Kwak2010,
abstract = {Twitter, a microblogging service less than three years old, commands more than 41 million users as of July 2009 and is growing fast. Twitter users tweet about any topic within the 140-character limit and follow others to receive their tweets. The goal of this paper is to study the topological characteristics of Twitter and its power as a new medium of information sharing. We have crawled the entire Twitter site and obtained 41.7 million user profiles, 1.47 billion social relations, 4,262 trending topics, and 106 million tweets. In its follower-following topology analysis we have found a non-power-law follower distribution, a short effective diameter, and low reciprocity, which all mark a deviation from known characteristics of human social networks 28. In order to identify influentials on Twitter, we have ranked users by the number of followers and by PageRank and found two rankings to be similar. Ranking by retweets differs from the previous two rankings, indicating a gap in influence inferred from the number of followers and that from the popularity of one's tweets. We have analyzed the tweets of top trending topics and reported on their temporal behavior and user participation. We have classified the trending topics based on the active period and the tweets and show that the majority (over 85\%) of topics are headline news or persistent news in nature. A closer look at retweets reveals that any retweeted tweet is to reach an average of 1,000 users no matter what the number of followers is of the original tweet. Once retweeted, a tweet gets retweeted almost instantly on next hops, signifying fast diffusion of information after the 1st retweet. To the best of our knowledge this work is the first quantitative study on the entire Twittersphere and information diffusion on it.},

    abstract = {At first blush, user modeling appears to be a prime candidate for straightforward application of standard machine learning techniques. Observations of the user's behavior can provide training examples that a machine learning system can use to form a model designed to predict future actions. However, user modeling poses a number of challenges for machine learning that have hindered its application in user modeling, including: the need for large data sets; the need for labeled data; concept drift; and computational complexity. This paper examines each of these issues and reviews approaches to resolving them.},

In particular, it is not clear whether as an information source Twitter can be simply regarded as a faster news feed that covers mostly the same information as traditional news media. In This paper we empirically compare the content of Twitter with a traditional news medium, New York Times, using unsupervised topic modeling. We use a Twitter-LDA model to discover topics from a representative sample of the entire Twitter.We then use text mining techniques to compare these Twitter topics with topics from New York Times, taking into considera- tion topic categories and types. We also study the relation between the proportions of opinionated tweets and retweets and topic categories and types. Our comparisons show interesting and useful findings for down- stream IR or DM applications.},
